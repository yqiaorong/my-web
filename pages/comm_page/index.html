                <h2>Mar 2023 - June 2024</h2>
                <p>During my time at Oxford University, I served as the secretary and a committee member 
                    of the Oxford University Pistol Club from March 2023 to June 2024. In this role, I 
                    was responsible for organizing club documentations and club events, including handling the membership, 
                    regular training sessions, varsity competitions, and the Freshers' Fair. My position required 
                    effective coordination with the Rifle Associations in Britain and the Home Office, 
                    fostering strong communication  skills and attention to detail. Through these experiences, 
                    I developed valuable organizational and leadership abilities while actively contributing 
                    to the club's growth and success.</p>
