                <h1>The measurements of the splashback features of dark matter halos using TNG300 and MillenniumTNG simulations</h1>
                <h2>Vogelsberger Lab, MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Jan 2024 - Ongoing</h2>
                <p>The splashback radius defines the boundary of a dark matter halo, where infalling dark matter particles 
                    reach their first apocenter and turn around. By examining the distribution of the splashback radius 
                    and the associated splashback features of dark matter halos, such as, the width and depth of the minimum 
                    in the gradient profiles of dark matter halos in cosmological galaxy formation simulations IllustrisTNG 
                    and MillenniumTNG. In short, the width of the gradient profile decreases with increasing halo mass and 
                    redshift, indicating a sharper transition in more massive and older halos. Conversely, the depth of the 
                    gradient profile increases with halo mass and remains relatively independent of redshift, suggesting 
                    that more massive halos have more pronounced splashback features regardless of their formation epoch.</p>

                <h2>Staresina Lab, University of Oxford, Feb 2024 - Ongoing</h2>
                <p>Sleep has positive effects on memory consolidation, a critical process for learning 
                    and cognitive function. By analyzing changes in both lower and higher-level visual 
                    representations of memories before and after sleep, we aim to understand how sleep 
                    affects the retention and modification of visual and semantic information.

                <h1>Attempting dream decoding with generalizable visual EEG encoding models</h1>
                <h2>DxE Laboratory, University of Montreal, May 2023 - Oct 2023</h2>
                <p> The realm of dreams remains relatively uncharted due to the reliance of subjective 
                    reports to access dream content. Building a dream decoding model is difficult due 
                    to the difficulty in collecting large sample sizes of dream experience. We trained 
                    an encoding model to generate EEG signals from deep neural network feature maps of 
                    visual images viewed during waking, and used the model to try and predict EEG 
                    signals collected during dreaming.</p>

                    <li>Preprocessed EEG data, including noise reduction and artifact removal, to ensure
                        accurate analysis of neural signals associated with dream content.</li>
