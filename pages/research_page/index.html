                    <h1>The measurements of the splashback features of dark matter halos using TNG300 and MillenniumTNG simulations</h1>
                    <h2>Vogelsberger Lab, MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Jan 2024 - Ongoing</h2>
                    <p>The splashback radius defines the boundary of a dark matter halo, where infalling dark matter particles 
                        reach their first apocenter and turn around. By examining the distribution of the splashback radius 
                        and the associated splashback features of dark matter halos, such as, the width and depth of the minimum 
                        in the gradient profiles of dark matter halos in cosmological galaxy formation simulations IllustrisTNG 
                        and MillenniumTNG. In short, the width of the gradient profile decreases with increasing halo mass and 
                        redshift, indicating a sharper transition in more massive and older halos. Conversely, the depth of the 
                        gradient profile increases with halo mass and remains relatively independent of redshift, suggesting 
                        that more massive halos have more pronounced splashback features regardless of their formation epoch.</p>

                    <h1>Attempting dream decoding with generalizable visual EEG encoding models</h1>
                    <h2>DxE Laboratory, University of Montreal, May 2023 - Oct 2023</h2>
                    <p> The realm of dreams remains relatively uncharted due to the reliance of subjective 
                        reports to access dream content. Building a dream decoding model is difficult due 
                        to the difficulty in collecting large sample sizes of dream experience. We trained 
                        an encoding model to generate EEG signals from deep neural network feature maps of 
                        visual images viewed during waking, and used the model to try and predict EEG 
                        signals collected during dreaming.</p>
